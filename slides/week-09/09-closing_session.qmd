## No session today due to illness

Instead, take the time to:

-   Have a look at the grading scheme and the template. You can find both Word documents on OLAT.

-   As noted in the *grading scheme* document, I highly recommend you to discuss your research idea during my office hours or send me a short draft (bullet points are enough!).

    -   Take the time now to start working on your idea for the term paper.
