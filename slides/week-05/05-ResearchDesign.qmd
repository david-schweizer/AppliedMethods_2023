## Deadlines

It is important to meet deadlines!

For the term paper, late submissions will result in deductions of the grade.

## General

A simple, uniform and readable formatted text makes a better & more professional impression:

-   Avoid highlighting text with colour

-   Avoid eye-catching headlines

-   Use justified print

-   Use uniform enumeration

## Formal

If you hand in a document, always try to follow these points (unless requested otherwise):

-   Include your personal information in the document:

    -   Minimum: Name, matriculation number

-   Include a title and the date of submission

-   Submit the document as a PDF.

## Formatting

If there are no strict rules for the exact formatting or you are unsure about it you can come back to the following:

-   **Font type:** Times New Romanm, Calibri, or Arial

-   **Font size:** 12 (footnotes in 10)

-   **Line spacing:** 1.5 or 2

-   **Margins:** 2.5cm on all sides

-   Avoid color and excessive use of bold font!

# Notes on exercises

*Example in Word*

# Reading strategies

## The Economist vs. American Journal of Political Science

**Short exercise \~ 5 minutes**

-   Discuss in breakout rooms: How does your reading differ when reading an article about a political event in a newspaper such as the Economist or in an academic journal?

-   What is your goal? What should you keep in mind?

-   Collect keywords

## Purpose of reading?

*Informative reading:*

-   You acquire facts that are of the same kind that you already know

-   Quantitatively, you know more, but qualitatively, you know nothing new!

*Reading to understand:*

-   Understanding findings, interpretations and theoretical arguments! Critical reading.

-   **Independently acquiring scientific knowledge.**

## Types of reading

![](types_reading.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
There are 4 types of reading. They can be used for different purposes and build on each other starting from the bottom.
:::
:::

## Types of reading: Elementary

-   Reading for enjoyment (e.g., novels) or informative reading

-   Not useful, if fundamental knowledge (about the text) is missing.

    -   That is, you understand the words and sentences but not necessarily their meaning.

## Active reading in general

-   Asking questions about the text

    -   What is communicated how and why? What is the author's opinion?

-   Search for and develop key words

    -   How does the author define terms? How does he/she differentiate him/herself from others this way?

-   **Make notes!** Mark relevant passages in the text & note your own thoughts

-   Change types of reading

## Types of reading: Examining

**What can I learn from the text?**

-   Systematically reading text in a short time ("read across") and reading cursorily ("skimming")

-   Getting an overview of structure and content

-   We are not interested in details or thorough understanding of the argument

-   Useful for the selection of relevant texts and sections

# (Group) work

Examining reading

## (Group) work: Examining reading

::: panel-tabset
## Task

**Exercise \~ Reading: 15 minutes, discuss: 5 minutes**

-   Find the key messages of a Foos & Bischof (2022):

    -   What is the (main) research question?

    -   What is the theoretical argument?

    -   What is the key result?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

:::
:::

## How to proceed?

-   Read the title and subtitle

-   Read the abstract

-   Read the headlines

-   Skim the introduction and the conclusion

## How did it go?

-   Did you manage to find the key messages in 15 minutes?

-   Could you follow your fellow students?

*Do not panic if not! You will get much better with time!*
:::

## Types of reading: Analytical

-   Knowing the text structure

    -   Actively collecting information about the text

    -   Being able to formulate the research question and argument in your own words

-   Interpreting the text

    -   Understanding the meaning of key words

    -   Comprehending the theoretical argument

-   Critical reading

    -   Evaluate relevance and identify weaknesses

## Types of reading: Comparing

-   Analyze texts in a comparative way

    -   What are similarities? What are differences?

    -   Ask the same questions for different texts and the compare!

-   Identify the most relevant sections for your own research project

    -   What specifically is relevant?

    -   **Developing your own thoughts and write them down right away!**

## How to read which texts?

::: panel-tabset
## Elementary

-   Rarely useful for scientific literature

-   Possibly useful for initial research on the topic if you are only interested in descriptives

## Examining

-   Usually the starting point for a literature search

-   Many texts that are potentially relevant to you, you should first read in a examining way. You will notice that

    -   they are not relevant after all; t

    -   that they are relevant but that you have sufficiently read them;

    -   or that you still need to read the texts analytically or comparatively

## Analytical

-   Required reading for seminars or lectures

-   Texts that you have not yet sufficiently explored in your literature search through examining reading

## Comparing

-   Texts that you are to present in presentation

-   Core texts for your term papers, such as those that form the basis for your theoretical argument

# ▶️ Research Design

## Deterministic vs probabilistic

::: panel-tabset
## In general

Deterministic relationships: ⟶ Physical laws

-   If some cause (independent variable) occurs, then the effect (dependent variable) will occur *with certainty*.

Probabilistic relationships: ⟶ Social sciences

-   Increases in a independent variable are associated with increases (or decreases) in the *probability of our dependent variable occuring.*

## Example - Democratic peace

Democratic peace: It is much less likely that there is war between two democracies than between countries where at least one is a nondemocracy.

-   Even if we observe two democracies at war, this does not mean we should discard the theory!

Deterministic theory: *There is no war between democracies.*

Probabilistic theory: *It is unlikely that there is war between democracies.*
:::

## Remember the causal mechanism?

::: panel-tabset
## Mechanism

![](theory5.png)

## Now: Causal relationships

In modern political science, our key goal is to establish whether there are causal relationships between (important) concepts!

\
**Economic development ⟶ democratization**

*or?*

**Democratization** **⟶ economic development**

## Hurdles

1.  Is there a credible mechanism that connects X to Y?

2.  Can we eliminate the possibiltiy that Y causes X?

3.  Is there covariation between X and Y?

4.  Have we controlled for all confounding variables Z that might make the association between X and Y spurious?

**A relationship between two variables does not imply causality!**

## 
:::

## Hurdle 1: A credible mechanism

::: panel-tabset
## Overview

In short, this represents an answer to the *how* and *why* of the causal relationship. *Why and how should a change in X cause a change in Y?*

How does a credible causal mechanism look like? The example of *economic voting*: *Variation in economic performance (X) influences the incumbent's chance of reelection (Y):*

Can you answer this: "How might varying economic conditions cause an incumbent's vote share to vary?

## Economic voting

A credible mechanism:

-   Voters value a strong economy because of low inflation or low unemployment

-   Voters hold the incumbent responsible for the state of the economy

-   If the economy is **strong**: Voters **reward** the incumbent with their votes

## Nobel prize

![](chocolate.png){fig-align="center" width="513"}
:::

## Hurdle 2: Y ⟶ X

This can be quite difficult:

-   Economic development & democratization

But also quite clear:

-   Gender & Attitudes about abortion policy

If we cannot dismiss the possibility that Y might cause X, we should proceed with caution!

## Hurdle 3: Covariation

We have to check if X and Y covary. Or if they are correlated or associated, respectively.

Normally, in order for X to cause Y, there should be some form of correlation between X and Y.

-   For example: An increase in X is associated with a decrease in Y.

-   We can demonstrate bivariate connections between two variables easily. More on this later on.

**Keep in mind: Correlation does not imply causation!**

## Hurdle 4: Spurious relationships

Usually, dependent variables are influenced by more than one independent variable.

Problem: We need to "control for" the effects of other causes of Y. We call these other causes Z.

-   If we do not control for Z, we are likely to make the wrong inference about whether X causes Y.

-   If we find a relationship between X and Y that disappears when controlling for Z, it is a spurious relationship.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
**Bivariate:** The relationship between two variables. **Multivariate:** The relationship involves multiple variabes
:::
:::

## Evaluating a causal relationship

![](path.png){fig-align="center"}

## Life satisfaction & democratic stability

Ronald Inglehart (1988) famously argued that life satisfaction (X) causes democratic stability (Y).

-   Credible mechanism?

-   Y causes X?

-   Covariation?

-   Spurious relationship?

. . .

**⟶ Yes, No, Yes, *Maybe***

Can you think of any variables Z that are likely to confound the relationship?

## Causality & research designs

In an ideal setting:

-   We want to observe dependent variable (Y) for the same cases with all values of the independent variables (X) to establish if X causes Y

**But:**

-   We cannot observe multiple outcomes for the same case!

We can use different strategies - **research designs** - to help us address the causal hurdles as best as possible!

# Experimental research designs

## Experimental research design: Motivation

*Imagine:* You are an advisor to a candidate running for a political office. The race is close. You still have the budget to run ads on television. Your boss is not sure if it will work and convince voters. What can you do?

-   What is the causal question embedded in this example?

-   How can we evaluate this?

. . .

*Possible idea:* Run a focus group. But still: What would the participants have said if they had not been exposed to the ad? We are missing a comparison group!

## Experimental research design: Definitions

*An experiment is a research design in which the researcher both controls and randomly assigns values of the independent variable to participants.*

-   That means, for example, we can **control** who sees and who does not see the ad.

-   In addition, we **randomly** divide our participants into a **treatment group** - who will see the ad - and a **control group** - who will see something else (this is called a **placebo**).

## But why?

-   Random assignment ensures that the comparison between treatment and control group is not polluted by other variables Z.

-   If our pool of participants is large enough, random assignment further ensures that treatment and control group are *identical* expect for the random assignment.

-   This means, any differences in the outcome between the two groups must be due to the independent variable assigned to them.

## The non-experimental alternative (1)

-   *Imagine:* We do not run an experiment and just run the ad. We still are interested in its effectiveness and conduct a survey asking people if they have seen the ad and for their voting intention.

-   We analyze a random sample of voters and see that people who have seen the ad are more likely to vote for the candidate you advise.

-   Can we be sure that the ad *caused* this?

. . .

No! People that have seen the ad might be *systematically* different from people who have not seen the ad.

## The non-experimental alternative (2)

People who have seen the ad might just be more interested in politics. Therefore, the variable *interest in politics* could be a *confounder* (Z).

![](path1.png)

## Crossing the hurdles

::: panel-tabset
## Mechanism

-   Here, there is no difference between experiments and non-experiments. A credible causal mechanism depends on our theory, not research design!

## Y ⟶ X

Using an experimental design, we can eliminate the possibility that Y causes X:

-   First, X is assigned before Y is measured. This means Y cannot cause X.

-   Second, X is generated by random assignment. Therefore, Y cannot cause it!

## Covariation

-   Again, establishing whether X is associated to Y is relatively easy for both experimental and non-experimental designs.

## Confounder

-   An experiment does not eliminate the possibility that some variable Z influences both X and Y.

-   But: By random assignment, the treatment and control groups should be identical with regard to every possible variable. Therefore, the comparison between the values of X should be unpolluted by any possible Z variables

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
Experimental designs are great to address this difficult last hurdle!
:::
:::
:::

## Random assignments & random sampling

Random assignment:

-   Randomly assign participants to treatment and control groups

Random sampling:

-   In short: Selecting cases for a study

-   Random sampling means that every member of a *population* has an equal probability of being selected.

## Varieties of experiments

::: panel-tabset
## Survey,

-   Survey experiments are intended to bring both high

    -   *internal validity* due to random assignment to treatment groups

    -   and *external validity* due to the benefit a a random sample

-   They are conducted via in-person, via telephone, but increasingly online.

## field,

-   A field experiment is conducted in peoples' everyday life. Still, they are randomly assigned in treatment and control group.

-   A example from economics: Are economic development policies effective? Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson (2011)

    -   Free fertilizer for randomly chosen farmers in Kenya, but not for others.

## and natural experiments

-   Although we as researchers cannot control the values of X and randomly assign the groups ourselves, natural events resemble experiments in important ways

-   For example, natural disasters:

    -   Treatment group = Citizens that are affected

    -   One could study how being affected by climate change-related natural disasters influences citizens' vote choice
:::

## Experiments are not perfect

::: panel-tabset
## External validity: Sample ...

-   Researchers have to recruit the participants for their experiments. It is extremely rare that we can draw a random sample from a population

-   Usually, citizens are recruited via advertisements. Therefore, the participants are not a random sample of any population. This so-called *convenience sample* means that it is unclear if our results generalize to a broader population.

## ... and stimulus

-   Our experiment is conducted in an artificial environment.

-   For example, participants have to watch the political ad. Would the effect be the same in their normal environment, e.g., watching at home?

## Ethics

Experiments might carry ethical dilemmas:

-   Is it fair that some farmers received free fertilizers and others did not?

-   If we expose participants to negative campaign ads, do we influence their voting behavior in the real-world?

Researchers have to be conscious about possible consequences of their *treatment*!
:::

# Observational studies

## Observational study: Definition

*A research design in which the researcher does not have the control over values of the independent variable, which occur naturally.*

*However, it is necessary that there be some degree of variability in the dependent variable across cases, as well as variation in the dependent variable.*

-   Can we still cross our causal hurdles? Yes!

-   However, we need to be cautious in our interpretation. Especially, in assessing the last hurdle: Confounders.

## Observational studies: Types

There are two pure types we will focus on here:

-   **cross-sectional** studies: focus on variation across spatial units at a single time unit

-   **time-series** studies: focus on variation within a single spatial unit over multiple time units.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Hybrid designs:

-   **time-series cross sectional:** variation over spatial (N) and time (T) units. Typically, T \> N.

-   **panel**: variation over spatial (N) and time (T) units. Typically, N \> T.
:::
:::

## Cross-sectional studies

Focus on variation between individual spatial units (citizens, districts, countries, ...) and explaining the variation in the dependent variable across them.

*For example, what is the association between voter preferences in a district (X) and the district's representatives voting behavior in parliament?*

*We would need to compare the aggregated preferences of voters from multiple districts with their respective representatives' voting behavior.*

**Still:** we need to cross our four hurdles to make causal claims!

## Time-series studies

Focus on comparison over time within a single spatial unit.

*For example, what is the association between economic growth and presidential popularity?*

*We would need measure changes in economic growth and presidential popularity (e.g., aggregated yearly or monthly).*

**Still:** we need to cross our four hurdles to make causal claims!

## Crossing the fourth hurdle

-   A big drawback of observational studies is that is very difficult to cross the last causal hurdle.

-   In theory, we would need to control for all possible confounders

-   But how can we know that we have controlled for all of them? Usually, we do not know!

-   Still, we can arrive at the conclusion that X causes Y. However, we need to formulate our conclusion more cautiously. In addition, it is likely that subsequent research will modify this conclusion.

# Group work

*Research designs*

## Group work

**Exercise \~ 20 minutes**

-   Now, you have heard about different research designs. What research design would be suitable to test **your** research question?

-   Present you research question to the others in your group, then discuss in break out rooms what research design you could use:

    -   Experimental or observational. Or both?

- Can you cross the four hurdles?


# Evaluating research

## Evaluating research

Equipped with this knowledge the advantages and disadvantages of research designs, you can incorporate this into your active reading:

-   What is the research question?

-   What is the theoretical argument?

-   **What is the research design? How do they address the four hurdles?**

-   What are the key results & conclusion?
