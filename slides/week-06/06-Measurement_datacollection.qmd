:::

## Concepts

-   **Term:** The concept's name

-   **Intension:** The concept's attributes (meaning)

-   **Extension:** The concept's empirical scope (operationalization)

. . .

-   **Term:** Social status

. . .

-   **Intension:** Subjective, Objective

-   **Extension:** (Objective): Education, Income, ...

## Measurement in the social sciences

-   Measurement is a problem for all social sciences

-   However, sometimes it is more straightforward

    -   For example, GDP as measurement for economic output

-   Usually, it is less straightforward:

    -   For example, how to measure poverty?

# Can you think of a hard concept to measure?

# How would you measure political sophistication?

. . .

Patrick Kraft has written a great article on the gender gap in political sophistication. You can a short article summarizing his research [**here**](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2023/09/11/changing-how-surveys-are-conducted-shows-there-is-no-gap-in-political-sophistication-between-women-and-men/).

# How should we measure political sophistication?

Take 10 minutes to read Patrick Kraft's [article](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2023/09/11/changing-how-surveys-are-conducted-shows-there-is-no-gap-in-political-sophistication-between-women-and-men/). The article is based on his paper [Women also Know Stuff: Challenging the Gender Gap in Political Sophistication](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/women-also-know-stuff-challenging-the-gender-gap-in-political-sophistication/111EA1DCE42C11172AA7F171EBBB2AAC) published in the American Political Science Review (APSR).

## Measurements - Problems

As mentioned, some concepts are easier to measure than others.

However, we can address four "problems" to ensure that we have a good measurement:

-   Conceptual clarity

-   Reliability

-   Measurement bias and reliability

-   Validity

## Conceptual clarity

**What exactly is the theoretical concept we want to measure?** Let's look at the example of income. How would you ask for income in a survey?

. . .

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
Problems with "What is your income?" For example:

-   Married couple with children and only one parent works. The other has factually an income of zero.

-   A student with no job but rich parents vs. a student with a job but no financial support from his or her family.
:::

. . .

**The best measure for income - and other concepts - depends on our research objective!**

## Reliability

A measure of a concept is reliable to the extent that it is repeatable or consistent. If we apply the same measurement rules to the same case, it should produce identical results.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Example from quantitative text analysis:

-   We want to identify the topic of climate change in politicians' social media posts.

-   We develop a coding scheme that describes when a post should be coded as climate related or not.

-   Multiple student assistants manually code a sample of social media posts.

-   Our measure is reliable when the students arrive at the same results!

## Measurement bias and reliability

Measurement bias describes the systematic over- or under-reporting of a variable's values. This is a problem if we want to know the "true" values for our observations.

But: For theory testing, we would still prefer **biased but reliable measures** compared to **unbiased but unreliable measures.** Why?

. . .

-   We look for the relationship between two variables: Even if our measure is biased upward, we would see the same association. E.g., higher values of X ➝ lower values of Y.

-   Can you come up with an example?

## Validity

::: panel-tabset
## In general

Our measurement is valid if it accurately represents the concept that we want to measure.

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
This seems straightforward! But take the example of prejudice.

-   If you ask people if they hold prejudices against others due to their race or ethnicity, would you trust their answers?

-   No. We would question the validity of their responses!
:::

We rely on multiple ways to determine if a measure is valid.

## Face \...

Face validity: Does the measurement measure what it is supposed to measure?

-   For a measure to have face validity, it's purpose and meaning should be clear to everybody

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
Example: Measuring age

-   by asking people for their birthday?

-   by counting their gray hairs?
:::

## Content \...

Content validity: Have we included all essential elements that define our concept?

We need to be aware of all essential elements that define our concept of interest!

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
Example: Measuring democracy

-   Our measure should include the element of *elections*

-   But what about places such as North Korea?
:::

## Construct validity

Is our measure related to other measures based on the assumptions of our theory?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Example: Democracy & economic development

-   We theorize that there is a positive relationship between the concepts of democratization and economic development

-   Then, there should also be a relationship between our measures of democratization and economic development
:::

## Validity & reliability

:::

## Application: Measuring democracy

::: panel-tabset
## General

-   One might think that a country *is* or *is not* democratic. However, we should probably think of it as a continuum.

-   A famous conceptualization of democracy is proposed by Robert Dahl (1971). Democracies are characterized by competitive elections and citizens' participation

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Projects measuring democracy include:

-   [V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy](https://v-dem.net/), [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/), and [Polity V](https://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html)
:::

## V-Dem across the world

## and over time

:::

# How would you measure democracy?

... when studying the effects of radical right populist parties on democracy? Take 10 minutes and inspect the [V-Dem's graphing tools](https://v-dem.net/graphing/graphing-tools/)

## Does measurement matter?

-   Different measurements can result in different conclusions about (causal) relationships!

**Main take-aways:**

-   Theory is essential for our measurements!

-   The way we measure our concept of interest should be guided by our research objective!

# ⏸️ 10 minute break

# ▶️ Data collection

## Secondary data

-   Fielding your own survey is resource intensive. It takes time and costs money.

-   Therefore, we oftentimes analyze **secondary data**. That is, data collected by others.

-   It is not easy to keep the overview of datasets and databases. You will get better with this over time and when specializing on a particular field of research!

## Political science datasets

There are many efforts to make data sets more accessible to researchers. Still: Google, google, google!

If you are curious have a look at these resources:

-   Find replication files in the [Harvard dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)

-   Browse throuh the[PoliSciData website](https://www.poliscidata.com/index.php) to find data by subfield

-   Or have a look at the collection of datasets by [Erik Gahner](https://github.com/erikgahner/PolData)

## Statistics

Of course, some statistics such as GDP or unemployment rates are provided by statistical offices of countries or organizations.

For example:

-   [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/de/)

-   [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/)

-   [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/)

Similarly, election results are published by agencies such as the [Bundeswahleiter in Germany](https://www.bundeswahlleiterin.de/en/bundeswahlleiter.html).

## Datasets I use in my research

-   The [German Longitudinal Election Study](https://www.gesis.org/gles/about-gles)

-   The [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/)

-   [ParlGov](https://www.parlgov.org/about/)

-   The [manifesto project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/)

-   [The PopuList](https://popu-list.org/)

# Group work

Measurement & data

## Group work

**Exercise \~ 30 minutes**

-   Now, its your turn: Think of any research question. This can also be the research question you have developed.
-   How would you measure the concepts you are interested in, that is, your independent and dependent variables. What about possible confounders?
-   Are your measurements valid?
-   Can you find databases or datasets to study your research question?

# ⏸️ 15 minute break

## Think

Guiding questions:

-   What type of variables do you use to measure your concept of interest? Is it categorial or continuous?
