## Evaluating research questions

**Remember?**

-   Why do presidents spend so much time talking about foreign policy during the campaign when only 1-2% of voters base their votes on it?

-   How do countries' economic interests affect their positions on the war between Russia and Ukraine

-   What are the consequences of climate change?

-   Why does the political left become social democratic in some Latin American countries and populist in others?

# Literature review

## Relevant literature

-   ... contributes to the explanation of the dependent variable

    -   In particular, the relationship in which you are interested.

-   ... gives you (and later in condensed form the reader) a good overview of existing studies

    -   "classics" and newest research

-   ... can be found via literature databases

## Literature review

**Short exercise \~10 minutes**

-   What makes a good literature review?

-   What is **not** a good literature review?

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
If your are unsure, have another look at: Chapter 3 - Powner, L. C. (2015). *Empirical Research and Writing: A Political Science Student's Practical Guide*. Los Angeles: Sage.
:::
:::

## What is not a good literature review?

-   Juxtaposition of literature: article after article

-   (Historical) background of a topic or the cases under investigation

-   Tracing the process of literature research

-   Telling the reader about every article or book you have read

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Read published articles in good journals to see how a literature review can (or should) be structured.
:::
:::

## What makes a good literature review?

-   Stress your contribution!

    -   You have to show that your idea adds to the existing literature.

    -   Highlight the *research gap.*

-   Short and precise presentation of the literature

    -   ... which is relevant to your research question,

    -   ... and fits to your theoretical argument!

## Important types of literature

-   Monographs

-   Collected volumes

-   Articles in journals

    -   Make sure that these journals use a peer-review procedure

-   Other literature such as conference or working papers

    -   These are not published yet, therefore it is not easy to asses their quality without experience!

## Important types of literature

**Review articles**

-   They do not make an empirical or theoretical contribution of their own. Objective : To classify / survey the literature on a particular area. E.g., *Annual Review of Political Science* publishes exclusively review articles.

-   Review chapters in edited volumes can serve similar purpose, but quality varies. E.g., *Oxford Handbooks* series

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Review articles are a good starting point, but pay attention to how old the article is.
:::
:::

## Important types of literature

**Recommendations**

-   The newest research is primarily published in academic journals.

-   It is unusual that new research is published via monographs or collected volumes.

    -   You should not start by looking for literature in these types of literature!

-   Textbooks can be a great way to engage with a new strand of literature for the first time.

## Good journals in political science

-   There are many! Their relevance also depends on your research focus.

-   They are ranked by Google Scholar, Scimago, etc.

-   There are databases such as SSCI that only list serious journals

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Steps to check journals:

-   Is it peer-reviewed?

-   Do you know the editors?

-   Is it ranked?

-   Do you know researchers that have published there?
:::
:::

## Good journals: Some Examples

::: panel-tabset
## General

-   American Political Science Review

-   American Journal of Political Science

-   Journal of Politics

-   British Journal of Political Science

## Methods

-   Political Analysis

:::

## Google Scholar

::: panel-tabset
## Advantages

-   Indexes hundreds of millions (!) of texts (Gusenbauer, 2019) if you can't find it on find it on Google Scholar, it probably does not exist

-   Mostly very easy to retrieve full texts

-   Good tools, such as clear citation information

-   Interdisciplinary (also a disadvantage)

## Disadvantages

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](lunch.png){width="345"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](lunch2.png)

-   No quality check

-   Less tools than other data bases

-   Interdisciplinary (also an advantage)

## Peer review

::: panel-tabset
## Process

![](peer_process.png){fig-align="center" width="507"}

## But, it is more complicated:

![](peer_review.jpg){fig-align="center" width="429"}
:::

## Google Scholar

**Short introduction**

![](scholar.png){width="996"}

## University library

::: panel-tabset
## BibSearch

![](library.png)

## Pro & Cons

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

-   You can access (most) journal articles via your university library!
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cons**

-   Not a good start to begin with your literature review. There are better (organized) databases.
:::
:::

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Conduct your search for literature with other tools and access the literature then via the university library!

## Categorizing literature

![](powner.png)

## Literature search

**Short exercise \~10 minutes**

-   Look for articles or books related to your research question via Google Scholar

    -   Try to access them

    -   Use the *cited by* function to have a look at further, similar articles

-   Create a literature matrix in Word or Excel and fill in the article you found

## Zotero

**Important links**

-   [Download](https://www.zotero.org/download/), here you also find popular plugins

-   Plugins for Word, LibreOffice and Google Docs should be installed automatically

-   [Citation styles](https://www.zotero.org/support/styles)

# Zotero

*Short introduction*

# ⏸️ 15 minute break

# ▶️ Building theory

## What is a theory?

. . .

::: panel-tabset
## King et al.

*.. a reasoned and precise speculation about the answer to a research question, including a statement about why the proposed answer is correct.*

King et al., 1994, p.19

## Powner

*... proposes an answer to the research question and tells why that answer is expected by specifying a mechanism, some chain of events or reactions or changes, that connects the independent (cause) variable(s) with the dependent (outcome) variable*

*... simplifications of reality ...*

Powner, 2015, p.22
:::

## What is a theory?

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
***To be clear, theorizing is not about having brilliant insights.** Theories don't have to be earth shattering or make seminal contributions to the field. They simply have to explain some phenomenon, and often the most obvious or commonsense explanation is the correct one. **Don't worry about trying to do something new that no one has done before**. To be honest, most theory in political science is of the "well, yeah," or "no, duh" level of brilliance: It's an obvious, common sense answer to a question. But all theories, even commonsense ones, need to be stated and tested before we can accept them. **Take a question that interests you, think about an answer, and go from there.***

Powner, 2015, p.22
:::

## Components of a theory

::: panel-tabset
## Expectation

-   What do you expect? A short form of the answer to the research question.

-   You will usually already have a first version of it in mind when you formulate your research question

## Causal ...

**... mechanism:**

-   Why does X lead to Y?

-   What are the intermediate steps that a change in the independent variable leads to a change in the dependent variable?

-   Different mechanisms can lead to the same results!

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}
Note: X - independent variable, Y - dependent variable.
:::

## Assumptions

-   Assumptions about how the world works that must be true, for your theory to work

-   Mostly implicit, some things are either so obvious or so established in a field of research that you don't need to mention it

-   Often too simplistic, but necessary to explore very complex issues

-   You do not check these assumptions in your work!

## Scope ...

**... conditions:**

-   Fore what cases do you think your theory should apply to? And why?

-   For example, comparative research on European politics:

    -   It almost always makes little sense to compare systems before or during the 2. world war. Conditions are so different that only a few theories will apply to everything
:::

## How to develop a theory?

::: panel-tabset
## Induction & Deduction

![](theory1.png)

## Differences

-   Steps are (almost) the same, but different order!

-   **Inductive:** individual cases, theory development based on these cases

-   **Deductive:** Development of theory through abstract analysis, followed by testing with data (mainly quantitative research)
:::

## From research question to theory

**General notes**

-   Venn diagrams, crosstabs, arrow diagrams that we we discuss today mostly do not belong in your homework, but will help you in the process

-   Iterative process, you continue to think about your theory as you write, interact with colleagues and faculty, and change it as you go along.

-   When writing: take cues from articles published in (peer-reviewed ) journals

## From research question to theory

**Expectations**

-   Good research questions have several possible answers

-   Find several possible answers and find out which are the strongest explanations for your question. You need the literature to do this!

-   While you are doing your literature review, your theory will also be changing. That is fine!

    -   But: Do not adjust theory to fit your (empirical) analysis!

# Group work

*From research question to theory*

## Group work

In small groups, find a better explanations for each of the following questions and apply it to an example *\~20 minutes*

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}

Q: Why do some fringe political groups resort to violence (terrorism) and others do not?

A: They think violence is the right answer.
:::

## From research question to theory

**Causal mechanism**

-   There can be different mechanisms that link the same variables.

-   E.g., the example from Powner on economic development and environmental pollution:

![](theory5.png)

# Group work

*Causal mechanisms*

## Group work

In small groups, find a causal mechanism between these phenomena *\~10 minutes*

-   Corruption in government agencies ➝ ? ➝ Probability of a financial crisis

-   Unequal power structures between two states ➝ ? ➝ Probability of war

-   Higher education among women ➝ ? ➝ Economic development

## From research question to theory

**Assumptions**

-   We make many assumptions about the political and social world. Be aware, what assumptions you make and what assumptions you have to state explicitly.

-   For example, assumptions when studying factors that influence voting behavior in Austria:

    -   Voting choice is free

    -   Voters act rational or maximize their payoffs

    -   Citizens vote strategically

## From research question to theory

**Scope conditions**

-   To which cases, do you think your theory applies?

-   Often obviously determined by the topic/research question: EU legislation you cannot be studied back to 1900; Presidential elections not in the UK

-   Mostly, though, a bit harder: consider, based on your expectations, mechanisms and assumptions, to which cases your theory should apply!

## From theory to hypotheses

-   Hypotheses are derived from theory and are based on observable implications of the theories

-   Patterns that should hold true if your theory is correct.

-   If your theories contain concepts, you should break them down to indicators here

    -   Probabilistic hypotheses: The more ... , the higher ... statements *(more common in social sciences)*

    -   Deterministic hypotheses: If ... , then... statements *(less frequent in social sciences)*

## From theory to hypotheses

**Examples**

Veto players (Tsebelis, 1995): The possibility to change policy depends on the number of actors and their ideological position. Hypotheses?

. . .

-   The more coalition partners are in government, the less likely is a change in policy.

-   The further apart coalition partners ideologically, the less likely is a change in policy.

-   Policy change is less likely in federal states than in unitary states.

## From theory to hypotheses

**Preview: Concepts**

-   Concepts can be operationalized differently with variables!

-   We need to be able to measure these variables.

-   How would you operationalize poverty?

. . .

For example, having less disposable income than 2.15 US-Dollar per day ([World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty))

## Until our next session

::: panel-tabset
## Mandatory exercise until 07.11.

-   Conduct a literature search for your research question and describe your strategy in few sentences.

-   Find 10 articles or books (chapters) that might be relevant for your research question. Tip: Skim the articles' abstract and/or introduction. At least 5 texts should be (peer-reviewed) published in academic journals

-   Hand in a list of the articles in a PDF document via e-mail until Tuesday, 07.11., by noon (12:00).

## Read

-   Have a look at these [blog posts by Raul Pacheco-Vega](http://www.raulpacheco.org/resources/reading-strategies/) regarding reading strategies.

-   Chapter 4 - Kellstedt, P. M., & Whitten, G. D. (2018). *The fundamentals of political science research*. Cambridge University Press.

## Think

Guiding questions:

-   How can we read (more) efficiently?

-   What research designs are there?

-   How to evaluate a research design?
